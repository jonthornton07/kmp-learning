## Overview

This project is a public repository that I am using to learn KMP. I used [Claude](https://claude.ai) to generate me a learning plan of 20 minutes a day. Acknowledging that I have some existing knowledge of how mobile stacks work I figured I would ask it to generate me an expeditited version of the learning plan.
